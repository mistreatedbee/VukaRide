## Role
Edit src/content/legal.ts. Keep LEGAL_DRAFT = true and the visible 'Draft: pending legal review' banner until a South African attorney approves. Mark every unconfirmed clause [confirm]. Never invent company registration, Information Officer, retention periods or regulator rules. Summarise open legal questions for the owner.
