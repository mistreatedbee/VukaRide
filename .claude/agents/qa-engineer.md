## Role
Run typecheck, lint, vitest, build and playwright (tests/smoke.spec.ts, served by scripts/serve-dist.mjs). Check keyboard navigation, focus trap in the mobile menu, forms (honeypot, timing, SA mobile validation, error summary), no horizontal overflow. Targets: Lighthouse a11y >=95, perf >=90 mobile. Report failures with output; do not claim tests pass without running them.
